📖 About the Project
Welcome! 👋
This repository contains my first end-to-end Amazon Sales Data Analysis project using Power BI and a realistic dataset inspired by actual e-commerce metrics. The dashboard showcases my entire analytical workflow and the insights I extracted—just as a professional data analyst would present to stakeholders.​

Objective:
Leverage real-world sales data to uncover business trends, improve decision-making, and support strategy for revenue and inventory optimization.

Dataset Columns:
Product Category, City, State, Sale, Units, Order Status, Date

⚙️ My Data Analysis Steps
Data Collection & Understanding:
Gathered product and order-level sales data, defined key questions relevant to business needs.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Profiled data, checked for missing values, identified duplicates and patterns in categories/cities.

Data Cleaning:

Removed errors and standardised values.

Handled missing/duplicate entries.

Ensured every metric was accurate and robust.

Business Analysis in Power BI:

Created interactive filters (city, state, product, status).

Built dynamic charts: sales, units sold, order status breakdown.

Implemented trend analysis with time-series graph.

Highlighted top revenue and product performance.

Insight Generation:
Interpreted patterns, compared regional results, identified outliers and growth opportunities.

Communication & Visualization:
Designed a dashboard for clarity, impact, and recruiter readability.​

Product Trends:
Boys’ Boxer Shorts and Baby Carriers are repeat bestsellers, aiding inventory forecasts.

Sales peak mid-quarter, often aligning with promotions and holidays.

Unit Productivity:
High-unit sales match high revenue, but some categories lag and present optimization targets.

💡 What I Learned
Translating messy real-world data into meaningful business answers.

Building a clear, professional Power BI dashboard for stakeholder presentations.

Thinking critically as an analyst, not just coding—a true consulting mindset.

🧑‍💻 How I Grew as an Analyst
Improved skills in data wrangling (cleaning, validating, transforming data).

Practiced visual design for business dashboards—making insights easy to spot.

Learned to ask the right questions, not just run queries.

Became comfortable presenting findings in a business-friendly format for recruiters.
